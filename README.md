### 1.  Sensitivity Analysis of Respiratory Model
  The forced oscillation technique (FOT) is a non-invasive method used to analyze impedance of the respiratory system by applying external signals to the respiratory system. Often Respiratory System is analyzed through computer simulation and results of these analysis are used to detect ‘Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases’, growth and development of lung etc. In this analysis, ‘One Compartment(RLC)’ model is used for lung mechanics modeling. 
  
### 2. Branched Cylinders: Dendritic Tree Approximations
  Explore some of the time independent electrical properties of single branched cables. Branched cables are an important means of modelling the passive electrical properties of axonal and dendritic trees. Consideration will be restricted to trees exhibiting only one order of branching, however the principles elaborated upon here are easily extended to higher order trees.
