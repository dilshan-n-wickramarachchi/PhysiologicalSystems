### 1.  Sensitivity Analysis of Respiratory Model
  The forced oscillation technique (FOT) is a non-invasive method used to analyze impedance of the respiratory system by applying external signals to the respiratory system. Often Respiratory System is analyzed through computer simulation and results of these analysis are used to detect ‘Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases’, growth and development of lung etc. In this analysis, ‘One Compartment(RLC)’ model is used for lung mechanics modeling. 
  
### 2. Branched Cylinders: Dendritic Tree Approximations
  Explore some of the time independent electrical properties of single branched cables. Branched cables are an important means of modelling the passive electrical properties of axonal and dendritic trees. Consideration will be restricted to trees exhibiting only one order of branching, however the principles elaborated upon here are easily extended to higher order trees.
 
 
### 4. Properties of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations
  Investigate some of the properties of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. Experimentally in a space-clamped axon of finite length the regenerative electrical activity in response to some supra-threshold stimulus is called a membrane action potential as the whole axonal membrane simultaneously participates in the events underlying the action potential. Without the space clamp the action potential would propagate with finite velocity away from the site of supra-threshold stimulus application and would thus constitute a propagating action potential. This latter event is the one that would occur physiologically. Many of the properties of the propagating action potential are similar, if not identical, to the membrane action potential. 
  Simulated features of Hodgkin-Huxley model 
• Threshold
• Refractoriness - absolute and relative
• Repetitive activity
• Temperature dependence
